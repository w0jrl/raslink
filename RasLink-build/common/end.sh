Usage:
End can be used in two ways.
If you type only the node to control,
End assumes that you want to drop all connected nodes from that node.
The node to control must be on your AllStar server.
example:
end 12345
If you type the node to control plus another node number,
End will drop that node.
example:
end 12345 67890
You must enter at least the node  to control.
